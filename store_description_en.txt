[Automatically Organize Your Downloads]

Is your "Downloads" folder cluttered with all sorts of files?
This extension allows you to automatically sort your downloaded files into the right folders based on rules you create.

For example, you can set rules to:
- Move image files (.jpg, .png) to your "Pictures" folder.
- Move document files (.pdf, .docx) to your "Documents" folder.
- Move music files (.mp3) to your "Music" folder.

You can freely customize the destination folder based on file type, keywords in the filename, and more.

Save time organizing your downloads and maintain a tidy workspace with this smart download manager!
